# Defender for Cloud baseline (AZ-500)

## Purpose
Establish early security posture management (AZ-500) with visibility into secure score and recommendations for the project scope.

## Scope and compliance
- Scope: Subscription-level baseline with focus on RG `rg-clopr2-katar711-gwc`.
- Region compliance: Germany West Central (EU-only requirement).

## What was enabled
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud baseline (Foundational CSPM / Free plan).
- Paid Defender plans remain disabled to avoid unnecessary cost at this stage.

## Secure score snapshot
Secure score provides a high-level view of posture. At this early baseline, scores may be low or incomplete until more services emit signals.

## Top recommendations observed
No recommendations were listed at capture time (baseline deployment just completed). Refresh later and replace this section with at least five recommendation titles when they appear.
