# Defender for Cloud configuration + key recommendations.\n

Plan selection: We enabled Foundational CSPM (Free) to meet baseline posture management requirements while controlling costs under an Azure for Students subscription. The paid Defender CSPM plan remains disabled to avoid per-resource charges.
Current posture: At this early stage (limited deployed resources), Defender for Cloud has not yet generated posture recommendations/risk calculations. As more baseline services (Key Vault, Log Analytics, networking) are deployed, recommendations will populate and will be captured and addressed in later sprints.


updates:


Defender CSPM was temporarily enabled to generate actionable recommendations and validate security posture. After collecting evidence, the plan can be disabled again to control costs under Azure for Students credits.
